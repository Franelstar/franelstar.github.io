            As part of my position as a teaching and research assistant (ATER) at the University of Orléans, I am conducting research in computer vision, building on the work from my doctoral thesis. Alongside my research, I teach at multiple academic levels, including the undergraduate Computer Science program (Licence Informatique), BUT1 and BUT2 in Computer Science at the IUT of Orléans, and the Master’s program in IoT (Master 1 IoT) at Polytech Orléans.

            Doctoral research conducted within the ANR project <strong>AI.iO ANR-20-THIA-0017-01</strong>, titled:  
            <em>“Integrating Knowledge into Deep Architectures for Computer Vision”</em>, as part of the <strong>CA (Constraints and Learning)</strong> research group.<br><br>
      
            Deep learning architectures have profoundly transformed artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, they still pose several challenges: a lack of explainability, strong dependence on large annotated datasets, and difficulty in integrating explicit prior knowledge.<br><br>
      
            This PhD project explores the hybridization of deep neural networks with structured prior knowledge to improve the generalization capabilities of image classification models. The work is structured around three main contributions:
            <ul>
              <li>A methodology for enriching datasets using auxiliary information in the form of rules, enabling the creation of evaluation benchmarks for knowledge-aware models—a gap still present in the research community.</li>
              <li>A novel learning approach integrating knowledge graphs into deep architectures through a hybrid loss function that combines cross-entropy with a distance metric in a knowledge-structured latent space. This allows the model to leverage the graph’s semantics to focus on harder examples.</li>
              <li>A concept-based classification framework that uses knowledge graphs both to model concept–class relations and to propagate information through graph nodes for high-level reasoning over concepts.</li>
            </ul>

            Master’s internship on integrating expert knowledge into deep neural networks for computer vision.<br><br>
            Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable learning complex representations from large amounts of data, often with remarkable generalization performance. However, these models have limitations, notably their heavy reliance on large annotated datasets and their difficulty adapting to realistic or underrepresented contexts in the data.<br><br>
            To address these challenges, this internship adopts a hybrid approach combining deep learning and symbolic artificial intelligence. We propose an original method to integrate expert knowledge, represented as ontologies, into computer vision architectures. This knowledge is formalized as knowledge vectors and introduced into the network loss function via a regularization term.
